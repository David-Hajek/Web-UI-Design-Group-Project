üë• Team Contributions
14. Each member should write a short reflection:

    Name (David-Hajek):
        Main contributions: JS. for the item storage, Main item grid, Navigation bar at the top, structure of the homepage, Item page, Random reviews, 
        The biggest challenge was to get the javascript to be read by html and then used, as I had to structure it, so that I can easily add in and export items, the problem was then solved and properly linked, making it easy to add new items, expanding the already existing grid.
        I learned how to properly use the (if) function of swelte, while also using item arrays to read data from them.

 Name (Tymoteusz-Walichnowski):
        Main contributions: HTML, CSS, JS for shopping cart functionality including the cart tab & cart storage.
        Challenges faced and how they were solved: Struggled with properly implementing cart storage to the product page, solved by taking a step back and learning how to properly create a svelte store and linking it to a page. Struggled with understanding CSS styling but solved by using the inspect element to gather better visuals on how the page was laid out
        What was learned or improved during the process: I learned a lot about Svelte functionalities such as Svelte stores and how to link certain parts of a web page together. My knowledge on creating effective and visually appealing website layouts was also improved from studying the code of my team members.
