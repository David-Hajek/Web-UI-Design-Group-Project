üß† Design Rationale
5. Why did you choose this theme/topic?
- We wanted to create a website that each of us would enjoy working on while also learning a lot.
  We knew we wanted to create a shopping website because of its variety in page types and features, and we ended up choosing a more niche sub-category of shopping websites - a merch website - to help define what features to add and what to focus on when creating it.
6. Key design goals and user needs identified
- Making the design as easy to use and as "fool proof as possible", using "proof" when buying clothing items, i.e - reviews.
7. Brief summary of research insights or personas used
- After analyzing similar websites, we noticed that many of them are focused on being visually interesting, but end up not being user-friendly from an usability and accessibility point of view.
- We created personas of various types to capture how wide of an audience our website might have and to make sure it is tailored to all of them.

üë• Team Contributions
14. Each member should write a short reflection:

David Hajek (David-Hajek):
- Main contributions: JS. for the item storage, Main item grid, Navigation bar at the top, structure of the homepage, Item page, Random reviews, 
- The biggest challenge was to get the javascript to be read by html and then used, as I had to structure it, so that I can easily add in and export items, the problem was then solved and properly linked, making it easy to add new items, expanding the already existing grid.
- I learned how to properly use the (if) function of swelte, while also using item arrays to read data from them.

Tymoteusz Walichnowski (Tymoteusz-Walichnowski):
- Main contributions: HTML, CSS, JS for shopping cart functionality including the cart tab & cart storage.
- Challenges faced and how they were solved: Struggled with properly implementing cart storage to the product page, solved by taking a step back and learning how to properly create a svelte store and linking it to a page. Struggled with understanding CSS styling but solved by using the inspect element to gather better visuals on how the page was laid out
- What was learned or improved during the process: I learned a lot about Svelte functionalities such as Svelte stores and how to link certain parts of a web page together. My knowledge on creating effective and visually appealing website layouts was also improved from studying the code of my team members. 

Elisabeth Sykorova (elisabeth-sykorova):
- Main contributions: Category filter, search filter, visual cohesiveness, contact & about pages, main page item hover effect
- The biggest challenge was understanding how html, css & javascript work together and how to work with them compared to working with something like C++.
- I have gone from almost no knowledge of web development to being able to confidently code and understand pages, transitions and different elements, and effectively use helpful tools. I have most improved in the usage of variables, forms, effects and transitions.
