üß† Design Rationale
5. Why did you choose this theme/topic?
- We wanted to create a website that each of us would enjoy working on while also learning a lot.
  We knew we wanted to create a shopping website because of its variety in page types and features, and we ended up choosing a more niche sub-category of shopping websites - a merch website - to help define what features to add and what to focus on when creating it.
6. Key design goals and user needs identified
- Making the design as easy to use and as "fool proof as possible", using "proof" when buying clothing items, i.e - reviews.
7. Brief summary of research insights or personas used
- After analyzing similar websites, we noticed that many of them are focused on being visually interesting, but end up not being user-friendly from an usability and accessibility point of view.
- We created personas of various types to capture how wide of an audience our website might have and to make sure it is tailored to all of them.

üîß Key Features

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
11. Svelte.js
- SvelteKit, Svelte Reveal
12. HTML/CSS/JS

13. Other tools (Figma, GitHub, etc.)

üë• Team Contributions
14. Each member should write a short reflection:

David Hajek (David-Hajek):
- Main contributions: JS. for the item storage, Main item grid, Navigation bar at the top, structure of the homepage, Item page, Random reviews, CSS support :)
- The biggest challenge was to get the javascript to be read by html and then used, as I had to structure it, so that I can easily add in and export items, the problem was then solved and properly linked, making it easy to add new items, expanding the already existing grid.
- I learned how to properly use the (if) function of swelte, while also using item arrays to read data from them.

KNOWN BUGS: In very rare cases, the mobile version of our page, hides our items unless the user scrolls a tiny bit lower, altho this bug is very rare. 

Tymoteusz Walichnowski (Tymoteusz-Walichnowski):
- Main contributions: HTML, CSS, JS for shopping cart functionality including the cart tab & cart storage.
- Challenges faced and how they were solved: Struggled with properly implementing cart storage to the product page, solved by taking a step back and learning how to properly create a svelte store and linking it to a page. Struggled with understanding CSS styling but solved by using the inspect element to gather better visuals on how the page was laid out
- What was learned or improved during the process: I learned a lot about Svelte functionalities such as Svelte stores and how to link certain parts of a web page together. My knowledge on creating effective and visually appealing website layouts was also improved from studying the code of my team members. 

KNOWN BUGS: The cart tab buttons do not truncate into a single screen when accessed from mobile, this was working on my home PC while testing but does not work on the college computers

Elisabeth Sykorova (elisabeth-sykorova):
- Main contributions: Category filter, search filter, visual cohesiveness, contact & about pages, main page item hover effect, adding content to page, main page nav, contact, about us mobile responsiveness
- The biggest challenge was understanding how html, css & javascript work together and how to work with them compared to working with something like C++.
- I have gone from almost no knowledge of web development to being able to confidently code and understand pages, transitions and different elements, and effectively use helpful tools. I have most improved in the usage of variables, forms, effects and transitions.

- KNOWN BUGS: After submitting the contact form, a confirmation message should appear. This used to work, however, in the final deployed version, it does not show up.

üöÄ Deployment Notes
15. GitHub Pages URL
https://david-hajek.github.io/Web-UI-Design-Group-Project/
16. Any deployment issues and how they were resolved
At first, the page just did not want to function at all when deployed, however moving it all to the root folder and adding more dollar signs with the word base seemed to fix all our troubles

üîÑ Reflections & Next Steps
17. What went well in the project
- The overall pace at which we worked, we did not really get stuck on one thing, as we all worked on our own thing, we rarely had to wait for X to be done. We worked as one, as we did not really have any disagreements in the project, making it a breeze.
18. What could be improved
- The Cart can be a bit odd when on mobile phone, overall we did pretty well on implementing the features.
19. One suggestion for future development
- Making cart, Form, etc. Actually functioning, if this would be a proper merch website.
